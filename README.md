## How to use this repository?

1. Read the article and review the examples in `notification.py` and in the README.
2. Go to the `exercises/` folder and open the exercise files.
3. Solve the exercises by following the instructions in each file.
4. Compare your solutions with the files in the `solutions/` folder.
5. (Optional) Run the tests to verify your solutions:

```bash
python test_exercises.py
```
